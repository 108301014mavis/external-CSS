	<h1>EVERYDAY ITALIAN SALAD</h1>
	<img src="Italian_Salad.jpg">
	<p>
		This simple <span id="a">Italian Salad</span> recipe is quick and easy to make, tossed with a zesty Italian	vinaigrette, and can easily double as a side salad or main dish.
	</p>
	<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2><br>
	To make this easy salad recipe, you will need:	
	<p>
		<span class="A">Greens:</span> I typically use a bag of mixed spring greens for this salad, but any favorite greens will do.<br>
		<span class="A">Veggies:</span> I kept things simple with just red onion and sliced pepperoncini peppers.  But feel free to add in extra salad veggies that you have on hand!<br>
		<span class="A">Tomatoes:</span> Any kind of fresh tomatoes would be great, or feel free to add some sun-dried tomatoes instead.<br>
		<span class="A">Croutons:</span> Feel free to use any leftover bread that you have on hand to make a batch of homemade croutons.  Or you can totally use store-bought croutons as well.<br>
		<span class="A">Parmesan:</span> The more the merrier in this salad, if you ask me!  I love tossing some into the big bowl of salad, plus grating extra on top of the individual salad servings as well.<br>
		<span class="A">(Optional) Nuts:</span> We love adding a handful of toasted pine nuts into this salad too.<br>
		<span class="A">Italian Vinaigrette:</span> A pantry-friendly combo of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon, garlic (or garlic powder), dried oregano, salt and pepper.<br>
